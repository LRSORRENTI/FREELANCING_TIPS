There's three points of liability. 

1. The first is transaction security.

- If you're dealing with sensitive info like 
CC numbers or payments or Healthcare info, 
then you can get sued out the ass if a breach 
is due to faulty code.

 There are actually legal 
standards for maintaining any of this info and/or
 transacting it.

2. The second is uptime. 

- If you not only build a 
website but maintain it under some sort of 
agreement AND if the customer has no direct 
way to maintain it themselves in an emergency, 
you may be on the hook for lost revenues caused 
by an outage.

3. The third and final is not meeting benefit
 targets. 
 
 - If you tell a customer that
 redesigning their website will get them more
 direct sales, and if sales maintain or 
decrease, then you possibly could be liable for
 lying about the services or products rendered.

Now, these are in order from most likely
 to least likely. 
 
 Easy way around the first one
 is to use pre-made tools to ensure someone 
smarter than you covered your ass and so that 
you can possibly shift the blame to the tool's
 maintainer.
 
  The second one can be solved by 
having a legally-sound service agreement signed 
by the customer ahead of time that sets
 standards for outage responses.
 
 
 The last one can be avoided by just not 
promising the customer any specific benefits 
related to sales increase or cost deduction.

Hope this helps!

        <p>
          If you're dealing with any sensitive info like credit card numbers,
          payments or Healthcare info, then you can get sued out the rear if a
          breach is due to faulty code.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are actually legal standards for maintaining any of this info
          and/or transacting it.
        </p>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="card-title">Uptime</h2>
      <p>
        If you not only build a 
        website but maintain it under some sort of 
        agreement AND if the customer has no direct 
        way to maintain it themselves in an emergency, 
        you may be on the hook for lost revenues caused 
        by an outage.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2 id="card-title2">
        Not meeting benefits targets
      </h2>
      <p>If you tell a customer that
        redesigning their website will get them more
        direct sales, and if sales maintain or 
       decrease, then you possibly could be liable for
        lying about the services or products rendered.</p>
